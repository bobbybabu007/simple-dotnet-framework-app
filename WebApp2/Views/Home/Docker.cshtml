        <h2>Containerization</h2>
        <p>
            Containerization is a technology that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a single, lightweight container. These containers can run consistently across different environments, making it easier to deploy and manage applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Containerization technologies like Docker have become increasingly popular for developing, testing, and deploying applications.

        <h2>Windows Containers</h2>
        <p>
            Windows Containers are a type of containerization technology specifically designed for running Windows-based applications. They are based on the Windows operating system and provide a way to isolate and run Windows applications in a controlled environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Windows Containers can be used for a wide range of applications, from traditional .NET Framework applications to modern .NET Core and .NET 5+ applications.

        <h2>.NET Framework</h2>
        <p>
            The .NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft. It provides a comprehensive library of classes and functions for building Windows applications, web applications, and services. While it's not the latest .NET technology, it is still widely used in legacy applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            When containerizing .NET Framework applications, it's essential to ensure compatibility with the Windows container environment and consider factors like version compatibility and dependencies.
