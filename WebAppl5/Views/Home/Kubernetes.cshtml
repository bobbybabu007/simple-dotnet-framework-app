        <h2>Kubernetes</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.kubernetes.io" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a powerful and flexible infrastructure for deploying and managing containers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration and is widely used in cloud-native application development.

        <h2>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</a> is a managed Kubernetes container orchestration service provided by Microsoft Azure. It simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters in the Azure cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
            AKS is a popular choice for organizations looking to run Kubernetes workloads on the Azure platform. It offers features like automated updates, scaling, and integration with other Azure services.

        <h2>Kubernetes with Windows Containers</h2>
        <p>
            Kubernetes supports both Linux and Windows containers, making it a versatile platform for containerized applications. With Windows container support, you can run .NET Framework and .NET Core applications alongside other workloads in Kubernetes clusters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Running Windows containers in Kubernetes requires careful configuration and consideration of the Windows node pool. It's a powerful solution for organizations with mixed Windows and Linux workloads.
